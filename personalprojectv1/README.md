# Personal Arduino Projects 

This repository contains my basic hardware control algorithms.

## Project: Personal Project V1
Basic control system made by using Arduino.

### Hardware Requirements
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Mega 2560 R3
* **Components:**  1 x Photoresistor, 1 x 9G Servo, 1 x Buzzer, 1 x Rgb 3 Color Module, 1 x IIC 1602 Lcd, 3 x 10k Ohm Resistor, 1 x Breadboard and Jumper Wires (M-M / F-M Assorted)

### Academic Context
This project is just a fundemental dive to world of microcontrollers and how they work. Intent is getting better understanding in this field to create better, more complex projects with my abilities.
